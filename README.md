# FitnessApp

This is the final project for my degree in .net programming at Nackademin, Solna.
The project is still in progress, final result with documentation will be available here at 22/5/2019.

It's built with .net core backend, and React frontend.
I'm using redux to store some data, but this is merely a test of the redux functionality and not officialy part of the
final exam.


#About the project

The goal of the project is to make a platform where users can measure the progress in their health/fitness related goals.
When finnished, the app will contain authentication, stored userdata, stored mealplans and training plans for registered users,
and corresponding UI's.

My goal is to continue development of the app to add more advanced features in the future.
